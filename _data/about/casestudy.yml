title: Empowering university students and unions
bold_content: |
  Thousands of freshers every year plunge themselves through a baptism of fire to adjust to unfamiliar surroundings and a whole new way of life. With communities of 10s of thousands of people and sprawling campuses, it is common to feel overcome by the dreaded feeling of “what the hell is going on?”. With this in mind, we have created a platform that Unions can use to display on a map every event happening on campus, that even the most inexperienced users of Google Maps will find immediately intuitive.

  The first iteration of What's On: has been designed with university Students' Unions in mind as a starting point, as it made tremendous sense to us, and provided the perfect launchpad from which our app can take off. This is just the start, however, as What's On: lends itself to so many businesses we would need two websites just to list them all. Theme parks, Offices, Town Centres, Cities, Museums, and even Schools! Wherever and whatever can be shown on a map deserves its own What's On: platform.
